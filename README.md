# CIS161-CPP-Final-Battleship

This was my final project for my C++ class taken in the Spring of 2018.

Battleship is often a two player stragety game where each player attempts to destroy the other players ships first. 

In this version of the game, one player plays aginst the computer.

The game begins with two empty boards and a prompt for the user to place his/her ships in three steps corosponding to the most left or highest location
- 'H' or 'V' for if they would like their ship to be horizontal or vertical
- 'A' - 'J' for what row they would like their ship to start in
- '0'-'9' for what column they would like to place their ship in

'V' 'A' and '6' were entered in the case below
